<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>There is a huge demand for plants in Bangladesh, but no specific ecommerce site is 
dedicated to this sector.
Our goal is to provide plants, fertilizers, plant containers, plant merchandises, and 
everything related to plants.</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Users can create an account and sign-up using email. </li>
<li> Users can update their profiles with their background information and experience.</li>
<li> Customers can search for products directly through the search bar, or filter by 
price or type.</li>
<li> A cart feature will be included which will record the chosen products and provide 
total price.</li>
<li> Customers can rate and review the products after purchasing.</li>
<li> There will be an admin dashboard through which user information can be 
monitored, accounts can be deleted and roles can be given (user, admin, 
employee etc.) by the admins.</li>
<li> Through the admin panel, the order list can be seen and monitored.</li>
<li> Expert panel through which users can contact experts for queries.
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>For the front-end we will use HTML, CSS, bootstrap as CSS framework and React. The 
website will be compatible with both PC and mobile browsers. We will also be using 
Redux which will help us to manage the states of our website.
</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>For the backend of the web application, we will be using Express which is a minimalist
backend web application framework for Node.js</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>For the database aspect of the project, we will use MongoDB, which is a NoSQL 
database.</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong></p>
<p>Payment will be done through Bkash/cash on delivery unless we find a better automatic 
alternative. </p>
<p><strong>Social Impact</strong></p>
<p>Planting trees is being encouraged all over the world, and unlike in other 
developing countries there is no such initiative in our country regarding this issue. 
Gardening is also seen as a hassle but through our expert panel suggestion , gardening 
will be easier than ever</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impacts</strong></p>
<p>Pollution is ever-increasing, and global temperature is rising each 
year. Tree plantation is the way to overcome this issue. This website will make gardening 
easier, as all plants related accessories will be available at one place.</p>
<p><strong>Business Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>As there is a huge demand for gardening, this will be a profitable 
business. Many investors will also be interested in the project. </p>
<p>This will also create employment opportunity as experts will be hired for providing 
suggestions, and deliverymen will be required to deliver the products. </p>
